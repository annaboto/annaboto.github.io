I've found that the best thing about being a mother is the fact that you get more than one life to live. You live a new childhood and a new teenagehood through your kids. I assume you also live a new youth and a new adulthood, but I still haven't tested that. 

The second best thing is that you get to be a goddess. When your child is a toddler, and you get home, and she receives you like the light of day. 

The third is that you get plenty of laugh.
