I've found that the best thing about being a mother is the fact that you get more than one life to live. You live a new childhood and a new teenagehood through your kids (I assume also a new youth and a new adulthood, but I still haven't tested that). 

The second best thing is to get to be a goddess. When your child cries, and you take her in your arms, and she instantly stops crying. When she's a toddler, and you get home, and she receives you like the light of day. 

The third is that you get plenty of laugh. 

There are many bad things about being a mother, too; I'll write about those in a separate post.
