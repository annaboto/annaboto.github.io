Today I read a headline in The Guardian that quoted an actress saying "Divorce is cruel. But some parts are to be recommended". It struck a chord because that closely resembles something I have often said, _and_ it is evidently so shocking as to merit a headline. My own formulation is "Don't get me wrong, it's not like I recommend divorce, but it has some advantages". 

I've often said this in connection to children, for two reasons. First, The Summer, a huge problem for working parents, ceases to be a problem; you only need to worry about your kids for half of it, and that really makes  it so much more manageable. And you get to have a real holiday with them during the time they are with you. Second, The Rest of the Year, in which, if you have shared custody, you again only need to take care of your kids half the time. I must say that a bit later I grew a bit unsure about whether the second is really an advantage, as it's also very schizophrenic: one week you are a single parent, the other a single person -- with very different schedules and obligations. Unfortunately, I didn't get to have enough experience with this perhaps-advantage to make up my mind, as my children's dad moved to a different country and so we stopped having shared custody. So the jury is still out. 

Regardless of what specifically are the advantages of divorce, however, what makes me super angry is other people's reaction to statements like "some parts are to be recommended" or "it has some advantages". In particular, I've found that people feel very uncomfortable about me saying that I am happy to share the work of raising kids. That I don't necessarily want to have them all the time. That I feel relieved when they go with their dad. Indeed, I've found that, as a divorced mom, I'm supposed to suffer. I'm supposed to be punished for my failure to make my marriage work by feeling empty and desperate when I'm deprived of my children. This is why statements like "some parts are to be recommended" are shocking and scandalous and so merit a headline.
